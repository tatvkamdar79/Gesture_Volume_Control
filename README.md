# Gesture Volume Control

This is basically a Gesture Volume Control Project where using the index and thumb tips we can control the Volume of the system 


To begin with run the following command to install all the dependencies for the project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the `main.py` file for the project. The `handTrackingModule.py` file can be used as a Module a well as a basic Hand Detection project. More about that [Here](https://github.com/tatvkamdar79/Hand-Tracking-Module)

The Volume will be set according to the Movement of the Tip of the Index Finger and the Tip of the Thumb.
